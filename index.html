                    Our Story: The Heart Behind CDM
                </h2>
    
                <p>
                    At CDM, every dish tells a story‚Äîa story of family, tradition, and a shared passion for great food. Our
                    journey began with two brothers, <strong>Durga Prasad Reddy</strong> and <strong>Mallikharjun
                        Reddy</strong>, carrying forward the legacy of our
                    family name, <strong>Chilukuri</strong>. Growing up, the kitchen was more than just a place for cooking;
                    it was where
                    bonds were strengthened, traditions were honored, and flavors came to life.
    
                    From childhood, we were captivated by the art of food‚Äîwatching our family prepare meals with love,
                    experimenting with spices, and serving dishes that brought smiles to everyone‚Äôs faces. This deep-rooted
                    connection with food led us to dream of a place where people could come together, enjoy authentic
                    flavors, and create lasting memories. That dream became <strong>CDM</strong>.
    
                    At CDM, we don‚Äôt just serve food‚Äîwe serve experiences. Every recipe is crafted with fresh ingredients, a
                    touch of tradition, and a lot of love. Whether you're here for a cozy family dinner, a celebration, or
                    just to satisfy your cravings, we promise a meal that warms your heart as much as it delights your taste
                    buds.
    
                    Come, be a part of our story. Welcome to <strong>CDM</strong>‚Äîwhere food is family! üçΩÔ∏è‚ú®
